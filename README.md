# Weather-Summary-Classification
Weather Summary Classification...........

Here's a brief description of each column in the weather dataset:
1.	Formatted Date: The date and time of the weather observation.
2.	Summary: A brief textual description of the overall weather conditions.
3.	Precip Type: The type of precipitation (if any), such as rain or snow.
4.	Temperature (C): The air temperature in degrees Celsius.
5.	Apparent Temperature (C): The "feels like" temperature, accounting for factors like humidity and wind.
6.	Humidity: The relative humidity, typically expressed as a percentage.
7.	Wind Speed (km/h): The speed of the wind in kilometers per hour.
8.	Wind Bearing (degrees): The direction the wind is coming from, measured in degrees.
9.	Visibility (km): How far one can see clearly, measured in kilometers.
10.	Pressure (millibars): Atmospheric pressure measured in millibars.
11.	Daily Summary (Target Variable): A more detailed description of the day's weather conditions.

# Objective:

The goal of this model is to classify the Daily Summary (target variable) using machine learning techniques based on the provided weather attributes.

# Key Features Used for Prediction:

- Temperature (C) & Apparent Temperature (C): Helps determine how warm or cold it feels.
- Humidity & Precip Type: Crucial for predicting conditions like rain or snow.
- Wind Speed & Wind Bearing: Influences conditions like storms or clear skies.
- Visibility & Pressure: Important for detecting foggy or clear weather.
- Model Approach:
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- Feature Engineering: Selecting the most relevant features for classification.
- Model Selection: Common classification algorithms include:
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score are used to measure performance.
- Potential Applications:
Weather forecasting automation
Assisting meteorologists in trend analysis
Enhancing weather-based decision-making systems
